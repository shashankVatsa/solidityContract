# solidityContract
// In this contract, we declare four variables of different types: myUint of type uint256, myBool of type bool, myString of type string, and myAddress of type address.

For each variable, we provide a setter function (e.g., setMyUint, setMyBool, etc.) that allows you to set the value of the variable. The setter functions take in the new value as a parameter and assign it to the respective variable.

Additionally, we provide getter functions (e.g., getMyUint, getMyBool, etc.) for each variable. These getter functions are marked with the view modifier, indicating that they do not modify the state of the contract. The getter functions simply return the value of the respective variable.

For example, in the setMyUint function, you can access the new value of myUint by using the parameter _value. Similarly, in other setter functions, you can access the new values through the provided parameters.

To retrieve the value of each variable, you can call the respective getter functions (e.g., getMyUint, getMyBool, etc.). These functions return the current value of the corresponding variable.

Remember to compile and deploy this contract on a suitable Ethereum network using a development environment like Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat, so that you can interact with it through transactions and view the values of the variables.
